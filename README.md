This It is a satirical website that provides information on how to survive in the university world as a student from my point of view. I have been struggling to find a way to survive in Australia since I moved here in 2018 to complete my higher degree in UQ. All the guidelines provided online are just general information or tips without any real-life examples, so I could not relate to them.
